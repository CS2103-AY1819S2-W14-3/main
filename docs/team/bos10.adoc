== Introduction

Hello! My name is Boston, a Year 2 Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore (NUS). This portfolio documents the CS2103T Software Engineering project I have been actively involved in over the past semester. The experience has exposed me to new technologies and helped me to develop relevant skills en route to being a Software Engineer.

== Project Overview : Battleship
'Battleship' is a desktop game application based on the classic Battleship guessing game. Borrowing the same game rules,
the game aims to recreate the adrenaline-filled experience by pitting the player against an intelligent computerized enemy.
However, instead of using a pencil and paper, players will be introduced with the command-line interface which they
will use to play the game.

My role was to design and implement a method to track and monitor the progress of the game. I managed to achieve this by
introducing the 'Statistics' feature of Battleships. By allowing the player to view their gameplay data, performance and
 score at any time during the game, players are able to plan their moves strategically.

The following sections will illustrate the feature and its implementation in more detail.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *ability to view the game score data at any juncture of the game*.
** What it does: By entering the `stats` command, the player will be given a pop-up display that contains information on
the number of successful hits, number of misses, number of enemy ships destroyed and even the player's current shooting
accuracy.
** Justification: This feature is crucial to user experience in the game as it allows players to track and keep up with the progress of the game. It is also fundamental as a basis for deploying strategies in the gameplay.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=bos10[Functional code]]

* *Minor enhancement*: added the *ability to compare the game scores between two games.*
** What it does: Upon winning a game, the game will automatically save the current game statistics into the storage folder
of the application. At the same time, the game will perform a comparison with the previous game statistics data (if any)
and will reflect if there are improvements from the previous game.
** Justification: This feature enhances the user experience by giving constructive feedback
through an analysis the player's past game. This encourage the employment of strategies to be better at the game.
It also demonstrates the application's ability to store game data which is fundamental to a future
highscore functionality in the game.
