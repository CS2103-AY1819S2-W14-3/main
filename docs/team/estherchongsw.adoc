== Project: Battleship CLI

Battleship CLI is an implementation of the classic game Battleship.

As part of a group project in the module https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-website/index.html[CS2103] in NUS,
my group had to morph an existing product, https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[`addressbook-level4`],
into a new product, and we chose to morph it into an Battleships, while keeping the original product's
distinctive feature of being operated through the command-line.

My role in the team was to design and implement the `Battle` feature, which:

  * Ensures that the human and computer players each take their turns in order,
  * Ensures that the game progresses in a fixed sequence of stages (from setting up the map, to placing ships, to attacking)

The following sections illustrate the feature in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to this feature.

== Summary of contributions

** What it does: it allows the player to make attacks, and ensures that the player and enemy take turns with each other.
