== Project Overview

My team and I were presented with an existing code base for a command line interface(CLI) address book application.
We were tasked to enhance or morph the product in to a product of our own choice.
We chose to morph it into Battleship.

Battleship is a desktop game application based on the classic Battleship game.
The user interacts with it using a CLI and it has a graphical user interface(GUI) created using JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

My role was to design and write the code for the `map` feature of the game.
The following sections illustrate the feature in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to this feature.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the map feature of the game*
** What it does: The player can initialise the maps to the size they specified at the start of the game. The players can place ships on their own map and shoot the opposing players map. The maps are displayed in the UI and each cell will change colour depending on its status.
** Justification: The map feature is crucial to the development of the game as it is the basis of all the interactions made in the game.
