== Project Overview

My team and I were presented with an existing code base for a command line interface(CLI) address book application.
We were tasked to enhance or morph the product in to a product of our own choice.
We chose to morph it into a game of Battleship.

Battleship is a desktop game application based on the classic Battleship game.
The user interacts with it using a CLI and it has a graphical user interface(GUI) created using JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

My role was to design and write the code for the `Enemy AI` feature of the game.
The following sections illustrate the feature in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer guides in relation to this feature.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Enemy AI feature of the game*
** What it does: It is a fully automated computerised enemy player that can randomly fill its own map and attack the player's ship with some level of intelligence.
** Justification: We wanted to make this single-player game as realistic as possible, and so the need for a smarter computerised player arose.
** Highlights: [placeholder]
** Credits: The algorithm for the enemy shooting references this article heavily. [http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/index.html[DataGeneticsBattleshipAglo]].

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Actively hit all milestones in time, and used git issue tracker to track tasks.
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Made many improvements to the intelligence of the pseudo-random algorithms used by the Enemy AI.
** Documentation:
*** Wrote the Game Rules section in the User Guide.
*** Wrote the Enemy AI section in the Developer Guide.
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments):
*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** Integrated Netlify to the project
