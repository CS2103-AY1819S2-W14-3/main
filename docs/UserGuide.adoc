== Introduction

Ships ahoy! Battleships is a retro game for people who want to have the joy of playing Battleships without the hassle and fuss of a physical game.

Battleships is optimised for people who want to use a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It can guarantee many hours of fun, especially between those long and boring periods of the day. Can't wait to get started? Head over to <<Quick Start>> to fire away!

[NOTE]
====
What is a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI)? An interface is how a user interacts with the computer. For example, you can use a mouse to click on a file to open it in Windows or MacOS. This is part of the interface for these operating systems. +

A Command Line Interface (CLI) interacts with the user by accepting words that are typed in by the user. Conversely, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) interacts with the user visually. It uses icons and graphics to show the user what the program is doing.
====

Battleships, as you will see, is a hybrid application. It combines both a CLI and GUI, meaning that the user must type in commands but will see the changes caused by those commands graphically.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Initialise the map: `init 6`.
+
image::Ui2.png[width=800]
+
.  Deploy your battleships:
..  Deploy your aircraft carrier: `put n/aircraft carrier c/a1 r/h`
..  Deploy your cruiser: `put n/cruiser c/c1 r/h`
..  Deploy your destroyer: `put n/destroyer c/e1 r/h`
+
image::Ui3.png[width=800]
+
.  Start the game: `start game`
+
image::Ui4.png[width=800]
+
.  Shoot the enemy: `shoot a1`
.  End your turn: `end turn`
+
image::Ui5.png[width=800]
+
.  Shoot the enemy: `shoot a5`

The commands will go on, until either your or the enemy's fleet is completely destroyed.

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Game Rules
// tag::gamerules[]
This section will describe the game rules and how to play the classic Battleship game.
====
*Goal*

Sink all your opponent's battleships before they sink yours.
====
====
*Captain, deploy ships!*

Depending on the chosen size of the map, as specified through the `init <map_size>` command,
the player will be given different numbers of each ship.

The ships available are:

* Cruiser: size 2
* Destroyer: size 3
* Aircraft Carrier: size 5

Here are the respective number of each ship in your fleet, depending
on your map size.

image::mapSizeFleetSize.png[width=550]
====
====
*Ready, aim, fire!*

The Player will always be given the first turn.
The Player may fire shots at the enemy map through the command `shoot <a1>`.

The player is allowed to continue firing until a miss.

Upon a miss, the player must end their turn here, and relinquish the turn
to the enemy through the command `end turn`. All's fair in love and war.
====

====
*Good Game!*

Whoever is first to destroy all their opponent's ship will be declared the winner.
Had fun? You can view the game statistics with the command `stats`.

== Features

====
*Command Format*
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`
Opens a help window that displays this User Guide. +
Format: `help`

// tag::map[]

=== Preparation Phase
This section describes the commands used in the preparation phase.

==== Map : `init`

Initialises both player's maps to the specified size. +
Format: `init MAP_SIZE` +
Example: `init 10`

_Figure 1_ below shows how the maps will be displayed in the UI.

.Player and enemy maps
image::initmapresult.png[width=750]

{empty} +
Throughout the course of the game, the cells in the map will change colour based on their status. +

[NOTE]
====
.Cell statuses:
- Hidden - Enemy map cell that has not been hit
- Water - Empty (i.e cell with no ship) player cell that has not been hit
- Water Hit - Empty cell that has been hit
- Ship - Player cell that has a ship and has not been hit
- Ship Hit - Ship cell that has been hit but not yet destroyed
- Ship Destroyed - Ship cell that has been destroyed
====

{empty} +
_Figure 2_ below shows which colour is used for each status.

==== Ship Management:
===== Placing a ship on the map: `put`

Adds a battleship onto the player's map. The coordinates specified is the position of the battleship's head. +

Format: `put n/NAME c/COORDINATES r/ORIENTATION t/TAG` +

Examples:

* `put n/Destroyer c/a1 r/vertical`
* `put n/Aircraft Carrier c/b1 r/h` +

[NOTE]
The head of a battleship refers to the top-most and left-most cell of the battleship. When coordinates are specified in the `put` command, it specifies the coordinates of the head of the battleship, as shown in the figure below.

image:BattleshipHeadExample.png[width=800]

.The coordinates of the `put` command refer to the coordinates of the battleship head.
image:BattleshipHeadExample2.png[width=800]

_Figure 3_ shows how a battleship is put at coordinate `a5`. The head of the battleship is therefore at `a5`. +

.The `put` command will put the battleship at a5, which is the battleship's head coordinate.
image::putshipheadexample.png[width=750]

The orientation of the battleship can be horizontal or vertical. The orientation of the battleship must be specified. It may be shortened to `h` or `v`. +

===== Listing all ships : `list`

Shows a list of all the player's battleships that are have been deployed on the map. There are four ways of using the `list` command:

1. List all the battleships.
2. List all the battleships that match a list of tags.
3. List all the battleships of a certain type.
4. List all the battleships of a certain type that match a list of tags.

Format:

* `list`
* `list t/[TAGS]`
* `list n/[NAME]`
* `list n/[NAME] t/[TAGS]`

Examples:

* `list`
* `list t/blueFleet`
* `list n/destroyer`
* `list n/destroyer t/blueFleet`

The list will show the battleship's head coordinate, the battleship's orientation, and the battleship's tags in square brackets. +

The format of each entry in the list is: `[NAME] [CURRENT LIFE] at [HEAD COORDINATE] [ORIENTATION] [TAGS]`.

.The `list` command
image::listexample.png[width=750]

The `list` command can also be used with tags. In the example provided, we have added the tag `bluefleet` to our destroyer at `f7`. Using the command `list t/bluefleet` will allow us to list all the battleships tagged with `bluefleet`.

.The `list` command with tags
image::listwithtagexample.png[width=750]

The `list` command can be used with both the name of the battleship and a list of tags. In this example from _Figure 6_ and _Figure 7_, we have created a fleet with two tags: `blue` and `green`.

.The `list` command showing our fleet
image::listall.png[width=750]

We are able to list a specific battleship by the name of `destroyer` with the tag `blue`, as in _Figure 7_.

.The `list` command with name and tags
image::listbytagbyname.png[width=750]

===== Locating ships by name: `find`

Finds battleships whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find NAME [MORE_NAMES]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hood` will match `Hood`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Wales Prince` will match `Prince Of Wales`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Bel` will not match `Belfast`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). +
e.g. `King York` will return `King George V`, `Duke of York`
****

Examples:

* `find Vengeance` +
Returns `Name: RSS Vengeance, Size: 4, Command: true, Position: d2`

[NOTE]
The position may not be displayed if the ship has not been placed.

===== List all tags: `listTags`

Lists all the tags that have been used to tag the battleships deployed on the map. +


Format: `listTags` +
Examples: `listTags`

[NOTE]
The list of tags is given in square brackets.

===== Selecting a ship : `select`

Selects the battleship identified by the index number used in the displayed ship list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

****
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed ship list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd battleship in the inventory.
* `find Prinz Eugen` +
`select 1` +
Selects the 1st battleship in the results of the `find` command.

=== Battle Phase

==== Beginning the battle: `begin`

Begins the battle against the computer enemy. +
Format: `begin` +
Alternative command: `start`

****
* After this command is entered, the program's AI will place its own ships.
****

==== Shooting at a coordinate: `shoot`

Launches an attack against given coordinate on the enemy's map. +
Format: `shoot COORDINATES` +
Alternative command: `attack`, `fire`, `hit`

Example:

* `shoot A6`

****
* The program will prevent an attack on an invalid coordinate..
* The program will prevent an attack on a square that has already been attacked.
* The program will prevent the user when attacking when they have already attacked. +
After attacking, they should use `endturn` to allow the computer to make its move.
****

==== Finishing a turn: `endturn`

Ends Player turn and starts Enemy's turn. +
Format: `endturn` +
Alternative command: `end`

****
* The program will end the player's turn and automatically play the Enemy's turn.
The player can see the enemy's attack reflected on the map and in the results box.
****
// tag::stats[]
=== Retrieving game statistics: `stats`

Prints a list of statistics related to gameplay, such as accuracy and current hits. +
Format: `stats`

Example:

* `stats`
// end::stats[]

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data `[coming in v2.0]`

(placeholder for Statistics saving)

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
