== Introduction

Ships ahoy! Battleship is a simple computer-based remake of the classic Battleship game, for people who want to have the
joy of playing Battleships without the hassle and fuss of dealing with physical game pieces.

Battleship is optimised for people who want to use a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It can guarantee many hours of fun, especially between those long and boring periods of the day. Can't wait to get started? Head over to <<Quick Start>> to fire away!

[NOTE]
====
*What is a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI)?* +
An interface is how a user interacts with the computer. For example, you can use a mouse to click on a file to open it in Windows or MacOS. This is part of the interface for these operating systems. +

A Command Line Interface (CLI) interacts with the user by accepting words that are typed in by the user. Conversely, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) interacts with the user visually. It uses icons and graphics to show the user what the program is doing.
====

Battleship, as you will see, is a hybrid application. It combines both a CLI and GUI, meaning that the user must type in commands but will see the changes caused by those commands graphically.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `battleship.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-3/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Battleship.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type commands in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute them. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  To begin playing, first initialise the map to a size between 6 to 10. eg: `init 6`.
+
image::Ui2.png[width=800]
+
.  Deploy your battleships:
..  Deploy your aircraft carrier: `put n/aircraft carrier c/a1 r/h`
..  Deploy your cruiser: `put n/cruiser c/c1 r/h`
..  Deploy your destroyer: `put n/destroyer c/e1 r/h`
+
image::Ui3.png[width=800]
+
.  Start the game: `start game`
+
image::Ui4.png[width=800]
+
.  Shoot the enemy's map at a specific cell. eg: `shoot a1`
+

+

The game will go on until either party's ships are totally destroyed.

Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Game Rules
// tag::gamerules[]
This section will describe the game rules and how to play the classic Battleship game.
====
*Goal*

Sink all your opponent's battleships before they sink yours.
====
====
*Captain, deploy ships!*

Depending on the chosen size of the map, as specified through the `init <map_size>` command,
the player will be given different numbers of each ship.

The ships available are:

* Cruiser: size 2
* Destroyer: size 3
* Aircraft Carrier: size 5

Here are the respective number of each ship in your fleet, depending
on your map size.

image::mapSizeFleetSize.png[width=550]
====
====
*Ready, aim, fire!*

The Player will always be given the first turn.
The Player may fire shots at the enemy map through the command `shoot <a1>`.

If the shot hit a ship, the Player may continue taking shots til a miss.
Upon a miss, the turn will be turned over to the enemy.
The same goes for the enemy. The enemy will take its shot automatically, firing until a miss, before
passing the turn back to the Player.
====

====
*Good Game!*

Whoever is first to destroy all their opponent's ship will be declared the winner.
Had fun? You can view the game statistics with the command `stats`.

[[Features]]
== Features
This section will describe the features of the game in more detail.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `init MAP_SIZE`, `MAP_SIZE` is a parameter which can be used as `init 10`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `put n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `put n/Destroyer t/bestship` or as `put n/Destroyer`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/alpha`, `t/best t/captain` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME c/COORDINATES`, `c/COORDINATES n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`
Opens a help window that displays this User Guide. +
Format: `help`

// tag::map[]

=== Preparation Phase
This section describes the commands used in the preparation phase.

==== Map : `init`

Initialises both player's maps to the specified size. The size of the maps must be between 6 and 10, inclusive. +

The `init` command can be used at any point in time during gameplay. When used in the middle of a game, the `init` command functions like a "new game" command and will reset the board to a clean state.

Format: `init MAP_SIZE` +
Example: `init 10`

_Figure 1_ below shows how the maps will be displayed in the UI.

.Player and enemy maps
image::initmapresult.png[width=750]

{empty} +
Throughout the course of the game, the cells in the map will change colour based on their status. +

[NOTE]
====
.Cell statuses:
- Hidden - Enemy map cell that has not been hit
- Water - Empty (i.e cell with no ship) player cell that has not been hit
- Water Hit - Empty cell that has been hit
- Ship - Player cell that has a ship and has not been hit
- Ship Hit - Ship cell that has been hit but not yet destroyed
- Ship Destroyed - Ship cell that has been destroyed
====

_Figure 2_ below shows which colour is used for each status.

// tag::ship[]
==== Ship Management:
===== Placing a ship on the map: `put`

Adds a battleship onto the player's map. The coordinates specified is the position of the battleship's head. +

Format: `put n/NAME c/COORDINATES r/ORIENTATION t/TAG` +

Examples:

* `put n/Destroyer c/a1 r/vertical`
* `put n/Aircraft Carrier c/b1 r/h` +

[NOTE]
The head of a battleship refers to the top-most and left-most cell of the battleship. When coordinates are specified in the `put` command, it specifies the coordinates of the head of the battleship, as shown in the figure below.

image:BattleshipHeadExample.png[width=800]

.The coordinates of the `put` command refer to the coordinates of the battleship head.
image:BattleshipHeadExample2.png[width=800]

_Figure 3_ shows how a battleship is put at coordinate `a5`. The head of the battleship is therefore at `a5`. +

.The `put` command will put the battleship at a5, which is the battleship's head coordinate.
image::putshipheadexample.png[width=750]

The orientation of the battleship can be horizontal or vertical. The orientation of the battleship must be specified. It may be shortened to `h` or `v`. +

===== Listing all ships : `list`

Shows a list of all the player's battleships that are have been deployed on the map. There are four ways of using the `list` command:

1. List all the battleships.
2. List all the battleships that match a list of tags.
3. List all the battleships of a certain type.
4. List all the battleships of a certain type that match a list of tags.

Format:

* `list`
* `list t/[TAGS]`
* `list n/[NAME]`
* `list n/[NAME] t/[TAGS]`

Examples:

* `list`
* `list t/blueFleet`
* `list n/destroyer`
* `list n/destroyer t/blueFleet`

The list will show the battleship's head coordinate, the battleship's orientation, and the battleship's tags in square brackets. +

The format of each entry in the list is: `[NAME] [CURRENT LIFE] at [HEAD COORDINATE] [ORIENTATION] [TAGS]`.

.The `list` command
image::listexample.png[width=750]

The `list` command can also be used with tags. In the example provided, we have added the tag `bluefleet` to our destroyer at `f7`. Using the command `list t/bluefleet` will allow us to list all the battleships tagged with `bluefleet`.

.The `list` command with tags
image::listwithtagexample.png[width=750]

The `list` command can be used with both the name of the battleship and a list of tags. In this example from _Figure 6_ and _Figure 7_, we have created a fleet with two tags: `blue` and `green`.

.The `list` command showing our fleet
image::listall.png[width=750]

We are able to list a specific battleship by the name of `destroyer` with the tag `blue`, as in _Figure 7_.

.The `list` command with name and tags
image::listbytagbyname.png[width=750]

===== List all tags: `listTags`

Lists all the tags that have been used to tag the battleships deployed on the map. +

Format: `listTags` +
Examples: `listTags`

[NOTE]
The list of tags is given in square brackets.

// end::ship[]

// tag::battle[]
=== Battle Phase

==== Beginning the battle: `begin`

Begins the battle against the computer enemy. +
Format: `begin` +
Alternative command: `start`

****
* After this command is entered, the program's AI will place its own ships.
* After the AI completes its placing of ships, you can take your first turn.
****

==== Shooting at a coordinate: `shoot`

Launches an attack against given coordinate on the enemy's map. +
Format: `shoot COORDINATES` +
Alternative commands: `attack`, `fire`, `hit`

Example:

* `shoot A6`

****
* The program will prevent you from attacking an invalid coordinate.
* The program will prevent you from attacking a square that you have already attacked.
* The program will prevent the you from making another attack when you have already taken your turn.
After attacking, you should use `endturn` to allow the computer to make its move.
****

// end::battle[]

// tag::stats[]
=== Retrieving game statistics: `stats`
